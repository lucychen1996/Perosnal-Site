	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p class = "aboutme">I am a first-year graduate student in the Master of Science in Infomation Sciences program at the University of Pitsburgh. I was born in China, but immigrated to the United States when I was 5 years old. I've lived in New York City for 6 years before moving to the surburbs near Philadephia where my family currently resides. I love to dance and ice skate. I attended Univerity of Pittsburgh for my undergraduate, graduting with a degree in Chemistry. During my undergraduate years, I was part of a research lab that dealt with using machine learning to predict chemical components of a substance. Ever since that research, I became more interested in data analytics field and and hope that I can merge these two fields of study in my future career.
