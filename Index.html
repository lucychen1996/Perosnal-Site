		<p class="aboutme">I am a first-year graduate student in the Master of Science in Infomation Sciences program at the University of Pitsburgh. I graduated from the Univerity of Pittsburgh with a bachelors degree in Chemistry. During my undergraduate years, I was part of a nanotechnology chemmistry research lab that dealt with using machine learning to predict chemical components of a substance. Ever since that research, I became more interested in data analytics field and and hope that I can merge these two fields of study in my future career.
